                <h2>Neural Network</h2>
                <p>A Neural Network is a type of machine learning model designed to mimic the way the human brain processes information. It consists of layers of interconnected neurons that work together to recognize patterns in data. Neural networks are used in a variety of applications, such as image recognition and natural language processing, due to their ability to learn and improve over time.</p>

                <p>Generative AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can create new content, such as text, images, audio, or code, based on patterns learned from existing data. These models, like GPT and DALLÂ·E, use deep learning techniques to generate outputs that resemble human-created content. Generative AI has applications in creative industries, software development, and automated content generation.</p>

                <p>Cryptography is the practice of securing information by converting it into a coded format. In programming, it involves using algorithms to encrypt (scramble) and decrypt (unscramble) data, making it accessible only to authorized users. Cryptography is essential for protecting online transactions, personal data, and secure communications.</p>
